# About Me
My name is Andrew Albano. I am currently a graduate student and NCAA D1 hockey player at the University of Michigan where I am pursuing an M.S. in Robotics. I previously graduated Summa Cum Laude from Norwich University with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. My robotics field of interests includes path planning, motion control, end-effector forward and inverse kinematics, and machine learning.

As a member of the NCAA D1 Ice Hockey Team at the University of Michigan, I balance a rigorous competitive schedule with a full graduate course load while maintaining academic excellence and achieving a 3.87 gpa. Similarly, at Norwich University I balanced the rigor of D3 Ice Hockey with my engineering studies earning a perfect 4.00 gpa. Simultaenously, I maintained leadership positions in two engineering honor societies, and represented the ice hockey team on the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee. I used my leadership positions to support student success by coordinating professional networking events, and lunch and learn events with several engineering companies.

My academic and leadership efforts garnered recognition with my selection as the David Crawford School of Engineering Presidential Fellow, and was honored at the state level by the Vermont Society of Professional Engineers as Norwich University's Student Engineer of the Year. My ability to balance multiple fronts of academics, athletics, while excelling in leadership positions earned recognition as Norwich University's Scholar-Athlete of the Year, and national recognition as an Academic All-American which identifies the country's top student-athletes.

My leadership experience, attention to detail, and passion for learning while diving deep to find solutions led to success in my previous internships. With the ability to learn new tasks independently while recognizing my limitations and seeking guidance when appropriate, I quickly garnered the trust required to lead major construction operations while working at Kiewit. 

While working for Amazon I honed my ability to dig deep through data, documentation, and a large network of peers to solve problems. I investigated the design, feasibility, and potential applications of accurate bulk flow accumulation measurements in Gen 11 Amazon Robotics Sortable
Fulfillment Centers. I documented my findings in a white paper and presented to regional management.

My leadership roles, extracurricular activities, and work experience have developed my ability to lead and work in a team-based environment, coordinate large projects, and successfully complete multiple tasks simultaneously under time constraints while delivering the highest standard of work.
